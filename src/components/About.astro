  <p>
    I bridge the gap between how we build and why it matters. With a strong technical foundation spanning startups to enterprises, I build remote-inclusive, high-trust teams where decisions are data-informed and grounded in expertise.

    My leadership philosophy is simple: <strong>Clear the path with sensible defaults, share the context teams need to decide, and create a safe space to learn from mistakes.</strong>
