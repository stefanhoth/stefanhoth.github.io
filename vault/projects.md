# Projects

A few things I've built on the side - mostly scratching my own itches around AI agents, job hunting, and home automation.

## [🔦 STARlog](https://github.com/stefanhoth/starlog)

*TypeScript · Gemini · Gemma4· runs entirely in the browser*

**Turn rough memories into interview-ready STAR stories - and see your gaps before the interview does.**

This little browser app, running locally without any server or login, helps you frame your experience into stories everyone can understand. Speak or paste a rough description of something that happened, and Gemini turns it into a polished story following the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) - then maps it against the competencies a specific job posting is likely to probe for. Everything runs in the browser; nothing leaves your machine except the API calls made with your own key.

### Motivation

Job hunting meant retelling the same experiences over and over - and losing the good details every time. I wanted a tool that takes a two-minute voice ramble and produces a structured story I can actually rehearse, without shipping my career history to someone else's backend.

### What I learned

While this project started as a conversion of a basic skill in my job application workflow it became so much more: I learned 
- how I create a usable product - and how to restrict myself
- how much implicit expectations need to be made explicit,
- how good UX is hard to get to
- how fun an AI-enabled product can be
- how a good platform and automation helps with shipping improvements effectively
- how a "council of agents" can improve the output substantially

I came out with a lot of practical puzzle pieces I will be using in the future.

## [🦀 crusty-proxy](https://github.com/stefanhoth/crusty-proxy)

*Rust · MCP · security*

**My AI agent never sees an API key - need-to-know, enforced by a proxy.**

crusty-proxy is an MCP that keeps API keys away from your AI agents and lets you cherry-pick their tools - read ✅, delete ⛔. Built for OpenClaw, works with any MCP client.

### The story

Self-hosting an agent means handing it credentials for every API it may ever call - which is one prompt injection away from leaked keys. crusty-proxy moves the trust boundary: the agent talks to the proxy, the proxy holds the secrets and refuses anything that isn't on the allowlist.

## [paperless-ngx-cli](https://github.com/stefanhoth/paperless-ngx-cli)

*Go · CLI · self-hosted*

**My document archive, one command away - scriptable from shell, cron, and agents.**

A terminal client for Paperless-NGX, my self-hosted document archive. Search, inspect metadata, and trigger bulk operations without opening a browser - built as a single static binary so it drops straight into shell scripts, cron jobs, and AI agent workflows.

### Lessons learned

A single static binary beats a "proper" package: the zero-dependency install is the feature people actually notice.
